# Muscle Map Website
[View the live project here.](https://joe-collins-1986.github.io/muscle-map/)

(Note: this is a fictious client generated for the purpose of developing this project to test my HTML and CSS essentials)

This website has been designed to provide users with a high-level overview of which exercises can be used use to train specific muscle groups. They will then be able to use these exercises to create a workout plan targeted to their number of available training days.

#### **First time visitor goals**
   1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to immediately identify the main purpose of the website.
   * Upon entering the site, users are greeted with the band name at the top left corner.
   * Hero image contains band members with musical instruments which immediately helps to identify the band.
   * The easiest option upon the opening of the website is to scroll down, which further confirms which band is this website about. 
   2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily navigate through the website.
   * Navigation bar at the top of each page clearly describes where the user will end up.
   * Logo at the top left corner always redirects the user back to the home page.
   3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily locate their social media links.
   * At the footer of each page, there are social media links. It is common to have social links there so a user would expect it to be there.
   4. As a First Time Visitor, I want the website's colour scheme and general feel to reflect the band's style.
   * Dark background, contrasting colours and sharp corners are common among rock band websites.

#### **Returning Visitor Goals**
   1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to revisit social media platforms through the links provided.
   * Social links are easy to find at the footer of the page, large icons are familiar and pleasant looking.
   2. As a Returning Visitor,  I want to easily find a way to contact the band.
   * Footer contains a contact section with contact email displayed.
   * Bands Instagram and Twitter are two more convenient ways to get in touch less formally.

#### **Frequent User Goals**
   1. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up for the newsletter.
   * User can easily see Get in Touch section at the navigation bar and click on it for a simple form containing email input, checkbox and a button to subscribe.
   2. As a Frequent User, I want to check for updates at the gallery.
   * User is one click away from the gallery, where new photos would be displayed at the very top.

## Further testing
* The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8, iPhone 7 plus, iPhone 8 plus, iPad, iPad pro, Galaxy S5.
* A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
* Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

## Bugs
* I was using column-count property to organise photos into two columns on the gallery page. However, when using media queries to organise photos into four columns for larger screen sizes, the column-count property was overridden by the original count of two. This was solved by adding !important rule.
