# Muscle Map Website
[View the live project here.](https://joe-collins-1986.github.io/muscle-map/)

(**Note:** this is a fictitious client generated for the purpose of developing this project to test my HTML and CSS essentials.)

This website has been designed to provide users with a high-level overview of which exercises can be used to train specific muscle groups. They will then be able to use these exercises to create a workout plan targeted to their number of available training days.

## Further Testing
* Tested across Google Chrome and Safari browsers.
* Viewed on a variety of devices using Web Developer Tools as well as several live desktop, iPad and mobile devices. 
* Each page tested by developer and friends to ensure functionality worked as expected.
* Issued to Slack community to review and feedback on.

## Bugs
  * Navigation bar had too much content to display neatly.
      - Resolved by utilising a YouTube tutorial on how to create and add JavaScript to create a hamburger menu for small screens.
  * Wanted the hero image on the home page not to be pushed down by the hamburger menu.
      - Resolved by setting the hero image and hero text to absolute values and moving the hero image back on the z-axis.
  * On publication to Git Pages the internal links did not work.
      - Resolved by setting them to relative paths and also removing the / from the front of the path.
  * After fixing the position of the footer I found that the content would disappear underneath it.
      - Resolved issue by producing a spacing div at the bottom of each page equal to the size of the footer ensuring the page moved down and essential content remained visable.
  * Had issue with re-using IDs.
      - Converted IDs to classes to be able to re-utilise accross pages for efficiency.
  * Images downloaded from Unsplash were very large and caused issues with the performance of the page when I used Lighthouse to evaluate them.
      - Reduced image sizes on each page to improve performance.

## Key Learns
* On following projects I will look to be more efficient in my use of CSS. In this project I styled each element as I needed them which caused a lot of duplication and redundant code. By defining the key classes and body formats I need across the entire project up front I will be able to optimise my code.
* In future projects I will aim to move away form the heavy use of pixels and instead primarily utilise rem (and in some specific circumstances em). This will provide more control over responsive design.
* In this project I developed media queries as and when i required them. As a result, I built them directly into the body of the CSS code alongside the elements they impacted. My Mentor advised that it would be best practice to consolidate these at the end of the CSS page. This would reduce line requirements by placing all media queries within a singular max-width media query appropriate to them. However due to the way I built and structured this project it would make the code difficult to read and locate so I have opted to leave this project as is for the sake of clarity but apply a more structured approach to my next project.
* On the Plan page, I made the cards responsive by converting from flex direction rows to columns and updating the margins so it showed correctly on a smaller screen. This was done as originally I had 3 cards when I built the functionality, however had I known at the point of build that I would only use 2 cards I would have used flex-grow and flex wrap instead for a more concise and efficient code. This was not an appropriate option for more that 2 cards as it would have shown them with varied widths when pushed onto the next line.

# Deployment
## Set up Local GitHub Repository
1. Go to my GitHub.
2. Select the + icon in the top right corner and select new repository.
3. Provide repository name and description.
4. Select Add Readme File.
5. Select Create Repository.

## Repository Framework
1. Select the repository on GitHub and open with Gitpod (green button).
2. Create required html pages.
3. Create assets folder.
4. Within assets folder create css folder, images folder, js folder & readme-assets folder.
5. Add required files to folders including style.css, images, script.js, etc.

## Update Repository
1. When adding a new feature create a separate branch to work in safely typing into the terminal "git branch 'name of required feature/update'".
2. Checkout the branch with "git checkout 'name of required feature/update'".
3. Make updates and test using "python -m http.server".
4. Once testing is complete add to Git staging area using "git add ."
5. Commit the changes and add a useful explanation of what action was done to track the history in GitHub using "git commit -m 'explanation of update'".
6. Once the feature is complete, fully tested, and ready to be added to the main branch first go to the main branch using "git checkout main".
7. Merge the feature branch into the main using "git merge 'name of required feature/update'".
8. Confirm merge was successful and then if it is not going to be re-used delete the feature branch using "git branch -d 'name of required feature/update'". (if deleting a branch with commits not merged to main delete with -D instead of -d)
9. Use "git push" to push the commits to GitHub. These will then appear in the live website if it has been set up in GitHub Pages.

## GitHub Pages
Deploy in GitHub Pages:
1. Log in to my GitHub and go to my Muscle-Map repository.
2. Access settings.
3. Under 'Code and Automation' go to pages.
4. Leave the source as Deploy from Branch.
5. Set Branch to Main.
6. Save.
7. Give GitHub a few minutes and the live URL is provided at the top of the GutHub Pages section of settings.
8. Any Git Pushes from the terminal whilst working on the Muscle-Map repository using Gitpod will now update in this live site.
