# Muscle Map Website
[View the live project here.](https://joe-collins-1986.github.io/muscle-map/)

(Note: this is a fictious client generated for the purpose of developing this project to test my HTML and CSS essentials)

This website has been designed to provide users with a high-level overview of which exercises can be used use to train specific muscle groups. They will then be able to use these exercises to create a workout plan targeted to their number of available training days.
